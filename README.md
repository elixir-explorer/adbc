# Adbc

Elixir bindings for Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC).

Adbc provides a standard database interface using the
Apache Arrow format. See [`Adbc`](https://hexdocs.pm/adbc/Adbc.html)
documentation for setting it up and the available drivers.

## Quick run-through

First, add `:adbc` as a dependency in your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
{:adbc, "~> 0.1"}
```

Now, in your config/config.exs, configure the drivers you
are going to use. Let's use sqlite3 as an example
(see [`Adbc`](https://hexdocs.pm/adbc/Adbc.html) for all
supported drivers):

```elixir
config :adbc, :drivers, [:sqlite]
```

If you are using a notebook or scripting, you can also use
`Adbc.download_driver!/1` to dynamically download one.

Then start the database and the relevant connection processes
in your supervision tree:

```elixir
children = [
  {Adbc.Database,
   driver: :sqlite,
   process_options: [name: MyApp.DB]},
  {Adbc.Connection,
   database: MyApp.DB,
   process_options: [name: MyApp.Conn]}
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

In a notebook, the above would look like this:

```elixir
{:ok, db} = Kino.start_child({Adbc.Database, driver: :sqlite})
{:ok, conn} = Kino.start_child({Adbc.Connection, database: db})
```

And now you can make queries with:

```elixir
# For named connections
{:ok, _} = Adbc.Connection.query(MyApp.Conn, "SELECT 123")

# When using the conn PID directly
{:ok, _} = Adbc.Connection.query(conn, "SELECT 123")
```
